  title: 'Incentive-Compatible Societies: Formal Environment Design for Truthful Meta-Knowledge'
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Formal environment engineering of communication protocols, sanction
    mechanisms, and audit hooks can render truthful uncertainty reporting subgame-perfect
    in multi-agent systems, ensuring agents accrue long-run penalties for misleading
    teammates and enabling principled mechanism design for multi-agent epistemics.

    '
  background:
    description: "The core claim of Eisenstein et al. is that incentive structure\
      \ yields meta-knowledge. We push this further by applying formal environment\
      \ engineering (Gardelli et al., 2006) to specify communication protocols, sanction\
      \ mechanisms, and audit hooks that render truthful uncertainty reports subgame-perfect.\
      \ Agents accrue long-run penalties for misleading teammates (e.g., claiming\
      \ confidence without evidence), enforced via periodic ex-post audits or sampled\
      \ tool cross-checks. This differs from purely empirical self-play by proving\
      \ incentive properties of the interaction. Combining Predictive Safety Networks\
      \ (Guo & B\xFCrger, 2019) adds safety constraints (e.g., mandatory abstention\
      \ zones), yielding guarantees about safe tool use. The significance is principled\
      \ mechanism design for multi-agent epistemics, applicable to high-stakes domains\
      \ surveyed in agentic LLMs (Plaat et al., 2025).\n"
