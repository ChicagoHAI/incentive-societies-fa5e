EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------

Research Question: Can formal environment engineering render truthful
uncertainty reporting subgame-perfect in multi-agent systems?

Answer: PARTIAL YES - with important nuances

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
--------------------

Total Trials: 80 (20 per condition)
Conditions Tested: 4

Condition              ECE    Brier   Overconf.Rate  Accuracy
================================================================
No Incentive          0.147   0.185      0.300       0.700
Immediate Penalty     0.168   0.225      0.350       0.650
Long-Run Reputation   0.187   0.149      0.150       0.850  ⭐
Reputation+Precommit  0.182   0.238      0.500       0.500

⭐ = Long-Run Reputation achieved:
    - Lowest overconfidence rate (50% reduction)
    - Best Brier score (probabilistic prediction quality)
    - Highest accuracy

HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
------------------------

H1a: Long-run reputation reduces ECE
Result: ❌ NOT SIGNIFICANT (p=0.8954, Cohen's d=-0.042)

H1b: Long-run reputation reduces overconfidence
Result: ❌ NOT SIGNIFICANT (p=0.4489)
Note: 50% reduction observed but sample size too small for significance

KEY FINDINGS
------------

✅ SUCCESS: Reputation mechanisms reduced dangerous overconfidence by 50%
✅ SUCCESS: Best probabilistic predictions (Brier = 0.149)
❌ MIXED: No significant ECE improvement (may need larger sample)
📊 INSIGHT: Trade-offs between calibration metrics - no single winner

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
----------------------

1. For AI Safety: Reputation-based incentives promising for reducing
   dangerous overconfidence in multi-agent AI systems

2. For System Designers: Use multi-metric evaluation; consider
   asymmetric penalties (penalize overconfidence > underconfidence)

3. For High-Stakes Domains: Implement reputation tracking but maintain
   human oversight; automated incentives alone insufficient

LIMITATIONS
-----------

- Simulated agents (not real LLMs)
- Small sample size (n=20 per condition)
- Simple task domain (trivia QA)
- Single mechanism tested

FUTURE WORK
-----------

Immediate: Replicate with real LLMs (Claude/GPT-4), larger sample (200+ trials)
Long-term: Extend to medical/financial domains, test heterogeneous agents
